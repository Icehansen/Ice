              <h4>A lot of people today are very much in their appearance. Besides, many young people love to show their bodies on beaches, parties etc., but that can be a problem today.
              Many young girls and boys around the world have been sexually harassed due to their attire.</h4>

              The “Song Kran” festival is a Thai New Year where you celebrate it by splashing water on each other. Some wear more clothes than others.
              Thai supermodel, actress, and activist Cindy Sirinya Bishops told media outlets about her unpleasant experience in the Thai New Year when she was sexually harassed by men.
              She has started a campaign “DontTellMeHowToDress” to tell how important this topic is.
              <br>
              <br>
              “Sexual harassment and assault is a very big issue in our society, but no one talks about it,” Bishops said.

        <h4>The third project is an exam project.
        The third project is about creating a process portfolio and an HTML website. This is an individual task as you have to create and code the website yourself.</h4>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <br>
                It all started with the fact that I chose to sketch how my website should look with colors and text types, what target group it is for.
                Next, I have chosen to make wireframes inside Adobe XD how the website should look.
                Since I have designed wireframes on Adobe XD, I have created a mood board and style tile.
                <br>
                Mood-board I have designed to find a concept and which themes to go with. Style tile provided an overview of which font to use, which buttons to include and which colors to use for the website.
                I have therefore chosen that my theme should be minimalist and simple, to get a quiet and calm mood.

                <h4>The next project of the semester was Installation.
                The group was to find and develop an installation concept for H. C. Andersen’s museum in Odense.</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                The group had to produce an academic report, a product of the group’s installation concept, an A3 poster and a client report as a leaflet.
                It all started with all multimedia designer students were visiting H. C. Andersen’s museum in Odense C, to get an insight into the mood of the museum as well as get inspiration for the project.
                In this project, the group had used methods such as Research, Persona and Design Thinking.

                <h4>The first project was for the group to re-design fyensrideklub.dk. Each group got a website to work with.
                The task was, that the group had to redesign the “fyensrideklub.dk” website, so it is more manageable, more modern and more credible.</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, the group had to design a client report, to tell and give a description of what the idea was and what the outcome would look like.
                Based on the result, the group had used various methods to redesign the website, eg the NUG model to give an insight into the various problems on the website, besides, the group had used the C.R.A.P model to give the group an insight into how user-friendly the website is. Eventually, the group had used the SMUK model to find the right target group to focus on.
